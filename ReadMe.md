# CSU Global CSC400 Algorithms and Data Structures stuff.

This repository is a collection of resources used and referred to in CSU Global CSC400 Algorithms and Data Structures.

It's not intended to be a production repository, but does have a good collection of resources.

This repository includes some of the code from **Data Structures and Abstractions with Java by Frank Carrano and Timothy Henry** in `/src/main/com.pearson.carrano/` 

Many of the examples from the textbook are changed from the original form as I performed exercises and projects from the book on them. Most of these sources in their original form (4th Edition) are available from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia here: https://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/341/code/text_code/Carrano4th/  

The repository also includes code samples from **Data Structures & Other Objects Using Java by Michael Main** in `/src/edu.colorado/` They have been changed from CP1451 (Windows) encoding to UTF-8. The original source code is available here: https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~main/edu/colorado/ This is an older resource and is unlikely to be updated. Some labs from this book may be found in the archive of resources for [University of South Carolina's CSCE 1461](https://cse.sc.edu/~mgv/csce146/labs/index.html) course.

You can also find the source of the contents of **Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne**'s [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) from **Princeton University's Algorithms, 4th Edition** as downloaded directly from the site on October 15, 2023. The Maven repository is not updated regularly. This code is used in the Coursera Course from Princeton called [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/), and other courses from Princeton. The code in this Jar is updated frequently, so best practice is to download the jar directly from Princeton's algs4 site or from their [Git repository](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4/). The jar includes source and compiled classes. Data files for the initial assignments in the Coursera course from [hello.zip](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/hello/specification.php) are included in the root directory.

It also incudes various projects and experiments I did for CSC400 in `/src/edu.csuglobal.cs400/`
This package includes work I personally did for the course, and is not an official package from CSU Global Campus.

-Have fun,
